# tutorial-html5ui-overlay
Code for an tutorial to put an overlay on an image with HTML5 and CSS3

This is the code for a [tutorial on putting overly on to an image](http://codesnippets.altervista.org/tutorials/2015/BLOG.2015-07-11.jssnippets.html).

As an experiment, after you download this source, open webpage in a webbrowser, then change the font-size from medium to large. Then change the *viewport* configuration by putting your browser into emulation mode for a mobile device.

This is the CSS code to change:
```body {margin:0px;font-size:medium;}```

This change put you into emulation mode:
* ctrl-shift-m - on Mozilla Firefox
* ctrl-shift-i - on Google Chrome
